        <h3>Django Installation</h3>
        <h5>Install Python</h5>
        <p>
            To install Python on Windows you need to download the latest Python release from <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">here</a>. Then, run the exec and follow the onscreen instructions.
            If you are using a linux distro with apt-get, you can install Python by navigating to terminal and entering the following commands:
        </p>
        <p class="code">
            sudo add-apt-repository ppa:home/python-3.6 <br>
            sudo apt-get update <br>
            sudo apt-get install python3.6
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are using Mac OS X, first, install a package manager- this tutorial will suggest Homebrew. Open terminal with GCC capabilities (<a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">here</a>), and run
        </p>
        <p class="code">
            ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
        </p>
        <p>
                Then, follow the script instructions. Now you need to insert Homebrew directory at the top of your PATH environment variable
        </p>
        <p class = "code">
            export PATH="/usr/local/opt/python/libexec/bin:$PATH"
            <br>OR<br>
            export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:$PATH                
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, install Python with
        </p>
        <p class="code">
            brew install python
        </p>
        <h5>Install Django</h5>
        <p>
            Once Python is installed, to install django, run:
            <p>
        <p class = "code">
            pip install Django==2.1.3
            <br> or <br>
            pip3 install Django==2.1.3
        </p>
            depending on the version of pip you have installed with your python distribution. Now Django should be installed and executable by Python!
            To create your first project, cd to where you want your project to be located, and type
        </p>
        <p class="code">
            django-admin startproject myproject
        </p>
        <p>
            where myproject is the name you want to name your project. Then enter,
        </p>
        <p class="code">
            python manage.py runserver
        </p>
        <p>
            from the root directory of the newly created website, and navigate to the address it mentions, which should be localhost - http://127.0.0.1:8000/ 
        </p>
        <p>
            If you see a landing page, you installed Django properly!
        </p>
